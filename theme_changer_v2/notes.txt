what it has to do is:
        - kitty
        - nvim
        - wallpaper
        - i3 windowborders
        - palette from imagick

        - save the palette from imagick to a file and then use it for everything

so what we need to do first is the "browser" with diffrent themes that can be activated or be saved.


1. print menu
2. select
        - select w numbers
3. print menu 2
4. select
